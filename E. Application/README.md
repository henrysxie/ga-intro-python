## Lemonade Accounting

Write a function that takes as arguments how many lemonades he/she sold and over how many hours. Function should print out how much profit the user made, as well as the user's average hourly income.

Assume the following:

- It takes 4 lemons to make a lemonade
- Each lemon costs 50 cents
- Cost of the lemons is your only expense
- You're selling each lemonade for 5 dollars
- When prompted, the user will input valid integer values

If stuck, consider the following techinques:
1. Write down in plain English what you want to do, step by step using comments (prefix each line with `#`)
2. Perform wishful programming, e.g. `profit = revenue - cost` before defining `revenue` and `cost`.
