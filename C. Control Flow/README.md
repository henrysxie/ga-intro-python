# Control Flow

## If Statement

Use `input` to prompt user for their first name and store in a variable called "first_name"

Create an if/elif/else statement that prints:

- "That's a long name!" if name is longer than 10 letters

- "Nice, that's a name of medium length." if the name is between 4 and 10 letters long

- "That's a short name." if the name is shorter than 4 letters

- Given that the name is of medium length, check whether the name is of even length. If so, print: "It's of even length too!"


## Looping
1. Construct a list of numbers between 0 and 200 that are divisible by 33

2. Given the following list
["Donald Duck", "Mickey Mouse", "Daffy Duck", "Goofy", "Minnie Mouse", "Pluto"]
Get the sum of all of the lengths of these strings.
